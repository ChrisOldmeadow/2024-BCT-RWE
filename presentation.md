## Problems with the RCT

- Expensive 
- Long duration
- Not always possible
- External valididity
    
    Real-world evidence uses data from patients receiving routine clinical care outside of trial settings, offering a chance to identify and address gaps in clinical trial evidence.
    
## RCTs also have potential problems with internal valididity

- blinding
- subjective outcomes
- missing data
- intercurrent events

    
## "Real world data"

* EMR
- Administrative datasets 
- Cancer registries
    
## Observational data and the "C-word"

"Dear author: Your observational study cannot prove causation. Please replace all references to causal effects by references to associations."

- Confounding means association does not imply causation. 
- Avoiding causal language in observational studies doesn't resolve this issue.
- Without clear causal language, the purposes and outcomes of much observational research become indistinguishably mixed.
- Associational questions are easy to formulate and straightforward to answer
- Causal questions, on the other hand, are not always easy to formulate.

## The Target Trial

 If we want to estimate the causal effect of a specific chemotherapy regimen on breast cancer outcomes, we first need to clarify what we mean by "the causal effect of this chemotherapy regimen on breast cancer outcomes." A useful approach is to define the causal effect in our population as the effect that would have been observed in a hypothetical trial where individuals were randomly assigned to either receive this chemotherapy regimen or an alternative treatment for a certain period
 
 a causal analysis in observational data can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a hypothetical trialâ€”the target trial
 
 A key advantage of specifying the target trial is that it forces investigators to consider the intervention of interest and the time period during which it takes place.

## Minimising the effect of confounders


- if the goal is associational analysis - no adjustment for confounders is needed
- if goal is causal then confounder adjustment is necessary
- DAGs are useful tool for considering confounders
- "Draw your assumptions before your conclusions"
- forces the research team to carefully think through the confounding variables and their interrelationships

## Propensity scores

- Probability of receiving a treatment conditional on confounders
- can use a logistic regression model to get a probability for each person
- "Given two people with the same probability of receiving treatment, but one person actually received treatment - what is the difference in their outcomes"
- Matching
- Weighting (IPTW)
 
 
 - allows assessment of how well you have achieved balance
 - does not specify an outcome model so is robust to this
 - not robust to the model for the treatment
 - there are doubly robust methods (one of the models can be misspecified)



## IPTW

Goal: estimate the relationship between treatment and outcome in a population where the treated and untreated are "exchangeable"

- Intuitively this can be done by creating a pseudo-population, where everybody is both treated and untreated (this breaks the link between treatment and confounding as everybody gets both)
- 


## Propensity matching

- create a "matched population" where the treated and untreated are exchangeable
- eg for every treated person, find an untreated person that was similar in every other way bit was not treated
- Propensity scores allow is to determine similarity
- Propensity score is prob of treatment
- For each treated individual find a untreated individual with a similar propensity score




## What about un-measured confounders

- Should perform a sensitivity analysis
- How robust are the results/conclusions to possible important un-measured confounders
- The E-value - How big a relative risk (between exposure and confounder) would need be to nullify an effect
- If bigger than any of the measured ones then that means unlikely
- If small then casts doubt on the results

This tells pandoc to create a standalone (-s) reveal.js presentation (-t revealjs) with the output filename of presentation.html from the input file mypresentation.md.

You can also add other options like -V revealjs-url=path/to/reveal.js if reveal.js is not in the default path and other reveal.js specific options in the YAML front matter to customize the presentation. -->
